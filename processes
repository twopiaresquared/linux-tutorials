Need real time information about the processes?
Use $ top

Want to kill a process? Use Signals
SIGHUP: Hangup NOHUP is don't hang up
Example: Say you want to start firefox 
Easy way is that you type firefox in the terminal and it beging. However, your terminal is handling that process and it cannot do anything else. We use the nohup command.
$ nohup firefox &
 and the firefox won't interfere with the terminal.'&' means the process will run in background and keep the shell running)

SIGINT: Ctrl + C (In short the most gentle way to kill the process.

SIGKILL: $ kill processid (does what it says)

You can actually control the priority of the processes, but you'll have to be   "nice"
If you type in $ top it will have a column "NI". This is the niceness level of the process right now. You can change the nicenes of the new process or renice an existing process
Example:

$ nice -n 10 apt upgrage
$ renice 10 -p pid

Want to know where the process are?
$ ls /proc
